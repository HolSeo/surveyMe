# surveyMe

## Description
SurveyMe is for product owners seeking client-reviews of their product. Users will need to pay $5 for five credits, via credit-card, which can send 5 surveys to any number of clients. The survey template is already made and provides 5 choices, a 1-star to a 5-star review. Owners can customize the survey title, email subject, body, and the recipient list (needs to be comma separated). The result of the reviews will be shown on the dashboard. Google Authentication is required. 

## Note
You do NOT have to enter in your actual credit card information! Enter in 4242-4242-4242-4242 as a credit card # and any random dates/numbers for security code and expiration date to get 5 credits or more everytime you purchase. This is a trial application, no actual money is actually collected or used!
